# Abstract 

This document establishes the different policies and rules governing the maintenance of Pharo code.
It describes the concerns of compatibility, support, backporting, and the management of deprecations.

Code evolves and changes happen.
Sometimes, an operating system stops exposing some functionality.
Sometimes, improvements must happen and, as the French say, you must break some eggs to make an omelet.
Pharo code will change thus, either driven by the community or as a reaction to external factors.

Also, this guide will evolve over time to add new policies as they are identified or modify ones that are considered for change.

## To Kernel or not to Kernel, that is the question

Throughout this guide, a difference will be made between kernel and non-kernel code.
Thus, policies will differ between them most of the time.
Exceptionally, when no distinction is made, the policy applies to both kernel and non-kernel code
The main reason for this distinction is that _Kernel code tends to be more stable and changes have more impact_.
Since compatibility issues arise with a large part of the standard library, and not only the `Kernel[-*]` packages in Pharo, this guide will use a larger definition of _Kernel_.

**Definition: Kernel.** The Pharo kernel is the set of packages that belong to the minimal image.
This includes all packages prefixed `Kernel`, but also important standard library packages such as `Collections`, `Strings`, and some `System` packages.
To obtain the exact list of kernel packages, you may execute the following expression:

```smalltalk
BaselineOfPharoBootstrap kernelPackageNames
```

This list entails in Pharo 12 a list of 34 packages.
Although this list can change and evolve over time, this evolution happens at a much slower pace than the rest of the standard library.

# Stable, development, and deprecated versions

As per the current state of affairs, Pharo versions can be organized into three families.

- **The stable version.** The latest Pharo official release.
- **The development version**. The Pharo version currently under development.
- **The deprecated versions.** The Pharo versions older than the current stable version.
 
# Breaking changes and backward compatibility of APIs

Not all changes have the same importance or impact.
In this section we will consider **breaking changes**.

For this, we need to consider the limitations of the Smalltalk heritage of Pharo.
Indeed, all class/method names are publicly accessible, and all instance variable names are visible from subclasses.
Taking this visibility as such leaves few degrees of freedom for implementors.
Instead, we consider the following definitions:

**Definition: Implementation details.** Implementation details are all those names that are not _purposely exposed_ to users and are meant to change.
By default, all names are implementation details unless explicitly documented otherwise.

**Definition: Public API.* A public API is every name that is *explicitly exposed* to users. They can be documented in tests, comments, or external documentation.

Given these two definitions, we can now define:

**Definition: Breaking change.* We consider a change as **breaking** if it modifies a public API.

All implementation details are thus not considered as breaking changes.
A conflict may arise if a third party depends on implementation details that were not clearly documented.
By default, such a change is not considered breaking and users are meant to adapt to it.
However, the impacted third party is invited to engage in a discussion in the community (mailing lists, discord channels, issue tracker), to consider the code as a public API, providing the corresponding documentation (tests, comments, and external documentation)

# Compatibility Policies

**Policy: Kernel compatibility period.** When a breaking change is introduced, compatibility must be ensured for 4 versions including the development version that introduces the change.

**Policy: Non-Kernel compatibility period.** When a breaking change is introduced, compatibility must be ensured for 2 versions including the development version that introduces the change.

**Policy: Deprecation and removal.** Every code kept for compatibility is considered _deprecated_ and to be removed after the compatibility period.

These policies will be declined depending on the nature of the change:
- If the change involves changing a name (renaming an existing class/method/variable), the old name should be kept during the compatibility period, working as expected by users.
- If the change involves changing the behavior of programs (method or class hierarchy changes), and the implementor cannot ensure a correct compatible behavior after the change (_e.g._ it introduces unexpected exceptions), the old code must be deprecated and kept as is, the new behavior should be introduced with a new name.

# Backports and bugfixes in released versions

Improvements in terms of bug fixes are accepted in released versions.

**Policy: Backporting policy.** All changes are subject to be backported to a previous version, as soon as all the following happen:
- they do not introduce breaking changes,
- there are community members willing to perform the work,
- there is no veto from the board or the consortium

# Deprecation rewritings

Deprecations can include rewriting rules that help users forward porting their code to newer versions.

**Policy: Automatic deprecation rewritings.** Automatic deprecation rewritings will activate by default when the deprecated code is at the end of its compatibility period.
This means that a deprecated method with a rewriting rule will not be rewritten _unless_ the code executes on the last supported version for that method.

For example, let's consider a method `log` that gets deprecated in Pharo v12 and has a compatibiity period of 3 versions.
This means that the deprecated method should be kept for compatibility in Pharo versions v12 through v14, being v14 the last version in which it is supported.
Thus, rewriting rules will only activate at the end of its compatibility period, being v14 in this case.

Users are free to disable deprecation rewritings entirely for their system using a setting.

# F.A.Q

- Q: If I have an application written in Spec, it means I only have a compatibility support of 2 years, right?

At least. Having a compatibility period does not mean we are going to break everything, it means we have a responsibility to keep at least N years

- How do we identify a code kept for compatibility? Only called from a deprecation?

Yes. A deprecation should document the method that is being deprecated.

- What happens after the deprecation period? Will the new name be renamed with the old name? or do we keep the new name?

That will depend on a case-per-case. Probably there is no one policy that fits them all.

- Does it mean that backporting features is accepted?

If it does not introduce breaking changes, and there is no veto, and somebody is doing it, I don't see the issue.

# Examples

## I want to replace some module

Consider that you want to introduce a re-design the AST hierarchy, and that the old and new modules will not be compatible.
A module replacement can be achieved by deprecating the old module.
Of course, there are no *one-to-one replacements* of classes/methods.

Client code needs to be rewritten to use the new module, while the old module remains working and compatible if possible.
There could still be the case where the old module cannot be supported anymore for major reasons (and thus breaking compatibility), see next point for it.

## I want to remove some functionality because it's deemed insecure/invalid

Consider for example removing features like PointerUtils, or removing old OS dependent code that has been deprecated/removed in OSs for some time.
Altough we can mark the given functionality as deprecated, there's no rewrite or compatibility possible.

In this case, we recommend to do the best effort possible to guard compatibility, and if not possible, document it and announce it properly.
We are still a small community!

## I want to *add* something at a double dispatch boundary

Consider the example of extending the AST with a new node supporting interpolated strings.
This impacts all existing visitors, which have to add new `visit` methods for the new case, or fail.

In this case, we recommend that the changes in ASTs are made to only affect code using the new functionality, and not impact those not using it.
In our example, old visitor should keep working when working on old code (without interpolated strings).
Of course, the old versions of the visitors will not work with new versions of the AST using the new features, but that's expected.
